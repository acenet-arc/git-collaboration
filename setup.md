---

Please see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git.

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Every participant should also have registered for a **GitHub account**
at <https://github.com> and know their username and password.
