```yaml
# _config.yml
# Jekyll configuration
name: My Cool Page
title: My Cool Page
description: A Documentation Page created with Jekyll
theme: jekyll-theme-architect
```

```markdown
<!-- index.md -->
# My Testing Docs Page

It Works! :-)

1. Have a `_config.yml` file setting a `title`, `name`, `description` and `theme`.
2. Add an `index.md` file with the landing page in Markdown.
3. Add more `*.md` files, e.g. `about.md`
4. add a link to [about.md](about) with: `[about.md](about)`
```
